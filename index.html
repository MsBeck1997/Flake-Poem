	<p>
		I wanted to go to the party,<br>
		But I woke up late this morning, and it threw off my entire day.<br>
		And I'm so very sorry, but I can't make it now, there's just no way.
	</p>

	<p>
		I wanted to go to the reunion,<br>
		But I got a flat tire, and I had to call for repairs.<br>
		They took so long and well the entire thing had me in tears.
	</p>

	<p>
		I wanted to go to our dinner,<br>
		But my dog got sick, I spent hours cleaning it up.<br>
		I can't show up like this, I can't even cover up!
	</p>

	<p>
		I wanted to go to class,<br>
		But I got stuck in traffic, it was bizarre.<br>
		I thought it was safer to turn 'round the car.
	</p>

	<p>
		I wanted to go to work,<br>
		But I slept though my alarm again.<br>
		And this happens every now and then.
	</p>

	<p>
		I wanted to go hangout,<br>
		"No thanks, flake," they crowed.
		It's not my fault though!
	</p>
